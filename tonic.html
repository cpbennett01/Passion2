            <summary>Gin & Tonics first became popular in the 1800s as a treatment for malaria among the British army while they occupied India. The tonic water contains quinine, which has anti-bacterial properties. Winston Churchill later declared gin and tonics to have "saved more Englishmenâ€™s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire." Probably would've been better for the rest of the world if they had died but go off I guess!</summary>

                You gotta follow your heart when measuring out this one. Throw some ice in a highball glass, pour in two to three-ish shots of gin in the glass and fill up the rest with a tonic water of your choice! If you want to spice it up, some of my favorite flavors to add are elderflower tonic water, blood orange juice, or lavender simple syrup with empress gin. Garnish with a lime or whatever matches your flavor palette. There are endless variations of G&Ts, get creative with it!
