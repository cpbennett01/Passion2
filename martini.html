            <summary>My personal favorite! This is a recipe for a dry martini, because putting an olive in a beverage is ludicrous and disgusting! The first known recipe for a martini was published in Harry Johnson's Bartnder Manual in 1888, intended as a variation of a Manhattan. The recipe called for old tom gin, vermouth, orange curacao, gomme syrup, Boker's bitters, and a lemon twist.</summary>
