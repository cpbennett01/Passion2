            Gin is one of the most versatile and and fun spirits to make drinks with. There are tons of flavors, endless ways to enhance or dilute it, and it is the perfect base for a hot girl summer cocktail. There are only three reasons someone would not like gin, they are underage, sober or you are boring or something I guess, I don't know.
